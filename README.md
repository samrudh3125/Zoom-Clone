# Zoom Clone
## Tech Stack
1. **Language:** TypeScript
2. **Framework:** Nextjs
3. **Video conference client:** getStream.io
4. **Authorization:** Clerkjs
5. **Styling:** Tailwind css
   
This project is completely build in **Nextjs**.Used the **Clerkjs** for authorization to easily handle users and user teams. Thought of building something on the **SFU** architecture( the mesh architecture used for the last project really created a mess). So did a little bit research about `mediasoup`. Later when started working realized that it is a very low level language and would take a lot of time. So used getstream.io which gives many functions inbuilt. Also maybe could add **sentry** to monitor the working.
